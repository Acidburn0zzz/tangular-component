## j-LazyImages

- Works only with `+v17`
- Place the component into the `<body` element

__Good to know__:

The component tries to find all `<img` elements with `data-src=""` attribute and if the element is visible then the component will update `src=""` attribute with the value from `data-src=""` attribute.
