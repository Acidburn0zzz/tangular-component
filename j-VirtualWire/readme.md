## j-VirtualWire

This is a very special UI component which can move elements from `element` to another `element` according to the selector and a value of the path. Look to example for understanding.

- `selector` {String} a selector for wires (default: `.virtualwire`)
- `delay` {Number} a delay in milliseconds for movement of elements (default: `10`)
